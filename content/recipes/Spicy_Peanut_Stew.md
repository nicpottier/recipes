# Ingredients

* 1 medium-size eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice
* 1 tsp salt, more to taste
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1/4 tsp turmeric
* 1/8 tsp cayenne
* 1/4 cup peanut oil
* 2 shallots, thinly sliced
* 2 inches fresh ginger, peeled and minced
* 1 to 2 jalape√±o chilies, seeded and minced
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1/3 cup tomato paste
* 1 small (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, preferably roasted
* 4 cups vegetable stock or water
* 1/2 cup natural unsweetened peanut butter (creamy or chunky)
* 1 medium-size zucchini, 6 to 8 ounces, cut in quarters lengthwise, then sliced 1/2 -inch thick
* 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (1 to 2 lemons)
* 1/3 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves, plus whole leaves for garnish
* Cooked rice, for serving

# Preparation

In a colander, toss eggplant with 1 teaspoon salt; set aside for 30 minutes. Rinse, drain well and set aside. In a small bowl, combine cumin, coriander, turmeric and cayenne; set aside.

In a large pot, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Add shallots and fry, stirring often, until soft, crisp and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer shallots to a large bowl, leaving oil in pot. Raise heat to high and add eggplant. Cook, stirring often, until lightly browned and just tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer to bowl with shallots.

Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to pot and heat over medium-high heat. Add ginger and chilies and cook, stirring for 30 seconds. Add spices and cook, stirring, 30 seconds more. Add onion and cook, stirring to scrape up any browned bits, until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, 1 minute.

Add diced tomatoes, stock or water, eggplant, shallots and a sprinkling of salt. Bring to a boil and cook 5 minutes. Place peanut butter in a medium bowl, add one or two ladlefuls of hot soup, and stir until emulsified, then pour mixture back into soup.

Reduce heat to a simmer, add zucchini, cover and cook 10 to 15 minutes, until vegetables are tender. Turn off heat and stir in lemon juice and chopped cilantro. Let cool slightly and taste; add salt if necessary. Serve in bowls with rice, garnished with cilantro leaves and chopped peanuts, if desired.
