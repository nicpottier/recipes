# Ingredients
* 1 cup red lentils (masoor dal), rinsed and drained
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 medium yellow onion, finely diced
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 inch fresh ginger, minced
* 1 medium tomato, diced
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 tsp ground turmeric
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 1/2 tsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)
* 1 tsp salt (adjust to taste)
* 2 1/2 cups water or vegetable broth
* 1/2 cup coconut milk
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)

# Preparation
1. Rinse the red lentils thoroughly until the water runs clear. Set aside.

2. In a large pot or deep skillet over medium heat, add oil. Once hot, add the diced onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 4-5 minutes.

3. Add the minced garlic and ginger, and saut√© for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

4. Add the diced tomato and cook for 2-3 minutes until it starts to break down.

5. Stir in the tomato paste and all the spices (turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala, chili powder, and salt). Cook for 1 minute to toast the spices.

6. Add the rinsed red lentils and water or vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the lentils are soft and beginning to break down.

7. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and add more water if needed if the curry becomes too thick.

8. Once the lentils are cooked, stir in the coconut milk and lemon juice. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to allow flavors to meld.

9. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.

10. Remove from heat and garnish with fresh chopped cilantro.

Serve hot with basmati rice, naan bread, or quinoa. Enjoy!
