# Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 large yellow onion, diced
* 6-8 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, peeled and grated
* 1 tablespoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1 teaspoon coriander
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 1/2 cups dried red lentils, rinsed and soaked (can sub with orange)
* 14 oz canned diced tomatoes
* 8 oz full fat coconut milk
* 3 cups vegetable broth
* 1/2 teaspoon salt, more or less to taste
* 1 half a lemon, juiced
* 1 green chili, thinly sliced (optional)
* 1 tablespoon kasuri methi (optional)
* homemade vegan naan, as a side (optional)

# Preparation
1. In a large heavy bottomed pot, add oil over medium heat. Once hot, add in onions and let cooked for 8-20 minutes. Add in garlic and ginger and stir together. Let cook until fragrant (another 1-2 minutes).

2. Add in all the seasonings (garam masala â€“ cinnamon) and stir together again. Allow to cook for 1 minute, stirring often, careful not to burn.

3. Add in lentils and stir. Then, add the tomatoes, coconut milk and vegetable stock. Scrap the bottom of the pot to remove any of the fond. Turn heat down to medium and let cook until thickened and lentils are soft (about 15-20 minutes).

4. Taste your dal and then add in salt, kasuri methi, and lemon juice as desired. Stir together and remove from heat. Top with sliced green chilis at the end if desired. 

Serve with naan.
