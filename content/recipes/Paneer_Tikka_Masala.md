 * ½ cup coconut cream (or non-dairy yogurt) (4oz)
 * 2 teaspoon garam masala
 * 1 teaspoon kashmiri chili powder (sub chili powder + smoked paprika)
 * 1 teaspoon coriander powder
 * 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
 * ½ teaspoon cumin powder
 * ½ teaspoon sea salt
 * ¼ teaspoon white pepper
 * ½ teaspoon lemon zest
 * 1 tablespoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)
 * 6 cloves garlic, minced
 * 1 inch grated ginger

## Tikka Masala Sauce Ingredients
 * 2.2 lbs roma tomatoes, ripe in season (or 2 ½ cups tomato sauce – 20oz)
 * 1 roasted red pepper, optional
 * 3 tbsp olive oil
 * 1 large sweet onion, finely diced
 * 6 cloves garlic, minced
 * 1 inch grated ginger
 * 1 green chili, optional (for spice)
 * 1 tablespoon coriander powder
 * 2 teaspoon garam masala
 * 1 ½ teaspoon kashmiri chili powder (sub chili powder + smoked paprika)
 * 1 ½ teaspoon cumin powder
 * 1 teaspoon salt
 * 1 tsp paprika
 * ¼ tsp turmeric
 * 1 tablespoon tomato paste
 * 1-2 cups hot water or vegetable stock
 * 15 oz can coconut milk
 * 1 tablespoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)
 * 1-2 teaspoon sugar, optional

## Tofu Marinade Preparation
In a bowl with a lid, add coconut cream to ginger in a bowl and combine well. Add tofu and gently combine, making sure all the tofu is covered. Place lid on bowl and marinade overnight, or at least 8 hours.

## Tikka Masala Sauce Preparation
If using fresh tomatoes, blend tomatoes and red pepper (if adding) to make a mostly smooth sauce. Set aside. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onions and let cook until they begin to caramelize, about 7-8 minutes, stirring often, careful not to burn.

Add in the garlic, ginger, and chili (if adding), and stir together. Cook for another 1-2 minutes or until it becomes fragrant. Add all the spices, from coriander powder to turmeric and stir (do not let spices burn!)

Add in tomato paste and stir together well to combine. Add tomato sauce and stir, scraping the bottom of the pan. Let cook until thickened (about 12-20 minutes). Preheat oven to 400F. Once thickened, add hot water or stock and stir together again. Let reduce until thickened again (about 15-20 mins).

While waiting for it to thicken, skewer the tofu cubes and rest them on a baking dish if possible or a baking sheet if not. Cook for 15-17 mins, flipping halfway. Then, place them until the broiler for 2-3 minutes, careful not to burn.

Once sauce has thickened, add coconut milk and stir. Then taste and add sugar if needed. Add tofu and kasuri methi and stir. Cook 5-7 mins. Turn off heat. Serve with naan and rice.
