* 1 small white onion, diced
* 1 tbsp grated ginger
* 1 tbsp minced garlic
* 1 red bell pepper, sliced
* 1 yellow or green bell pepper, sliced
* 1 cup sliced carrots

# Method
Warm skillet with deep sides over medium heat. Add onion with a dash of salt, cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger, cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add bell peppers and carrots, cook until tender, 3-5 minutes. Add curry paste and cook, stirring often for 2 minutes.
Add coconut milk and kale or spinach along with 3/4 cup water and sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Continue simmering until peppers, carrots and kale have softened, about 5-10 minutes.
Remove curry from heat and season with rice vinegar and soy sauce. Serve over brown rice, garnish with cilantro.
