* 2 large sweet potatoes
* 1 cup dried black beans (or 1- 2 cans of black beans)
* ½ white onion
* 3 cloves of garlic
* 1 tbsp cumin
* 1 head of Lacinato kale (or favorite kale/chard variety)
* Corn tortillas
* Goat cheese
* Salt and olive oil to taste
* Sriracha (optional)

1. In an instapot or pressure cooker, cook 1 cup of dry black beans with 2 cups of water, 1/2 white onion and 3 cloves of garlic,
1 tbsp of cumin. Cook according to instapot/pressure cooker instructions. When done, salt to taste. Smash some of the beans to 
achieve the consistency of loosely refried beans.

2. Peel and cut 2 large sweet potatoes into 3/4 inch chunks (ish). Toss in a bowl with a dash of olive oil and salt.
Spread on a baking sheet and bake at 375 F for about 40 minutes, turning the sweet potatoes every 10-15 min until golden brown.

3. De-stem (or don’t!) a head of kale leaves and sauté in a tsp of olive oil over med-high heat, for about 10 min. 
When wilted and cooked thoroughly, salt to taste. I like Lacinato/dino kale best, but any kale or chard works well.

4. Heat/toast corn tortillas on a comal/pan to soften and brown.

Load each corn tortilla with black beans, sweet potatoes, and sautéed kale. Top with goat cheese and Sriracha sauce.
