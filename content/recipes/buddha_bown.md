This is a grain salad bowl with a semi-sweet and spicy (to taste) hoisin-based sauce.

* 4 cups Mixed greens (particularly nice with a spring greens/spinach/arugula mixture)
* 2 cups brown rice/wild rice mixture
* 2 carrots
* Roasted pepitas (pumpkin seeds) or sunflower seeds as an alternative
* 1 block firm tofu (or tempeh if you prefer)
* 1 tsp cornstarch (optional)
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp red chili powder
* 1 cup ready (frozen or fresh) edamame

Press and drain the tofu. Cut into ½ - ¾ inch cubes. Toss in bowl with cornstarch, paprika, and chili powder (or any spicy seasoning). Bake at 375 F for 30 minutes, flipping every 10-15 minutes, or until the tofu has lightly golden tops. The cornstarch creates a crispy edge on the tofu, which texture.

Cook the brown rice-wild rice mixture on the stovetop or in an instapot/rice cooker. Let cool slightly, 5-10 minutes.

Shred carrots.  

To make the hoisin sauce:  (I’m not sure of the quantities here, as I normally eyeball this and then adjust to taste).

* ¼ cup (ish) hoisin sauce
* 1 tbsp Sesame oil
* 1 tbsp Lemon/lime juice
* 2 tsp Sriracha

Once the rice is cooked and cooled slightly, prep each grain bowl separately by adding ¼ of each ingredient in a mixing bowl and tossing with hoisin sauce, to taste. Top with pepitas.
