Prepare your favorite grain: brown rice, barley, quinoa, etc.

You can use any greens or roasted veggies in this dish. I like the combos of butternut squash and chard/kale, or broccoli and chard. But it works equally well with roasted brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes, etc.

Cut butternut squash into ½” – ¾ inch squares. Toss with olive oil and salt and roast at 375 F, flipping every 10-15 min.

At the same time, roast/pan fry brussel sprouts, broccoli, or broccolini, or sauté kale/chard/mustard greens.

Prepare Garlic-Tahini Sauce:
* 1 garlic clove
* ⅓ cup sesame tahini
* 2 to 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (more to taste)
* ⅓ cup water
* Salt to taste

Two options to prepare:
1. Use a mortar and pestle to mash garlic. Add tahini, lemon juice, mashed garlic, and salt in a bowl and whisk. Dilute with water until a thick but runny consistency.
2. Add ingredients to a Nutri-bullet/small blender and blend until thick but runny.

Put cooked rice/grain in the base of each bowl. Top with roasted veggies and greens. Drizzle with healthy amount of tahini sauce, to taste.
