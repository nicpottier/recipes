# Saag Ingredients
* 30 ml / 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 tsp cumin seeds
* a pinch of chilli flakes or fresh green chilli (optional)
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 1 tbsp finely chopped ginger (thumb-size piece)
* salt & pepper, to taste
* Â½ tsp turmeric
* chilli powder to taste
* 1 tsp garam masala, divided
* 2 bags spinach
* 1/3 cup almonds, soaked in hot water
* 2 tsp lemon juice, adjust to taste

# Tofu Ingredients
* One block tofu, frozen then thawed, excees water pressed out, cubed
* 2 tbsp corn starch
* 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
* 1 tbsp garam masala
* 2 tsp garlic salt

# Preparation
1. Toss tofu and spices together. Air fry at 375 for 15 minutes.
1. Heat up a large size frying pan, add a good splash of water and half of the spinach. Using kitchen tongs, move the spinach around the pan. Once most of it has wilted, add the second half and allow it to wilt.
2. As soon as the spinach has wilted, lift it out of the pan. Squeeze out excess moisture and chop roughly. Set aside.
3. Wipe the frying pan clean, then heat up oil in it. Once the oil is hot, add cumin seeds. Allow them to sizzle a little on low heat before adding in finely diced onion and a good pinch of salt.
4. Saute onion on low heat until almost translucent (about 10 minutes) before adding in garlic and ginger. Saute for another 5 minutes or so stirring frequently.
5. Make sure the heat is low, before adding in ground spices: turmeric, chilli, half of garam masala, plus more salt and some pepper. Mix spices into the aromatics and carry on pan-frying for another 60 seconds to toast them gently.
6. Add in minced spinach, vegan cream, a good pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon. Cover and simmer gently for about 10 minutes, then uncover and cook for further 5.
7. Adjust the seasoning and sprinkle the other half of garam masala on top.
8. Add tofu, mix together, serve over rice.
