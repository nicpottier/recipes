Cut butternut squash into 1/2 -3/4 inch cubes or thin strips. Toss in olive oil, salt, and pepper. Bake on 375 F for 40 minutes, flipping every 10-15 min. 

To make the pesto: 

* 2 cups fresh basil (or you can use kale, or arugula)
* 1/4 cup (ish) roasted walnuts
* 1/4 cup (ish) olive oil (or olive oil until it's the consistency you want
* 1/3 cup of parmesan or romano cheese
* Salt to taste

Blend the basil, walnuts, olive oil and salt until desired consistency. I actually like a bit chunky, as the walnut pieces give it a nice earthiness. Add parmesan and stir until mixed evenly. 

Mix the pesto with favorite cooked pasta, and top with butternut squash.
