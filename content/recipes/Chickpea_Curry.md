# Ingredients
1 tbsp olive oil
1 yellow onion, diced
5 cloves garlic, minced
4 fresh thyme sprigs
1 inch fresh ginger, minced or grated
3 medium globe tomatoes, rough chop
1 tbsp tomato paste + 1 tablespoon water
2 tbsp curry powder
1 tsp salt, more or less to taste
1/2 tsp all spice
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp garam masala
1/4 tsp turmeric
1/8 tsp red pepper flakes, more or less to taste
15 oz can coconut milk, full fat (400ml)
1/2 cup vegetable stock (120ml)
29 oz chickpeas, rinsed and drained (878g)
2-3 cups fresh spinach, packed, chopped

# Preparation
In a large skillet with high walls, over medium heat, add oil. Add onion and cook until softened. Toss in garlic, thyme and ginger to cook for an additional minute.

Next, add in your chopped tomatoes and cook for a few minutes to soften. Push down on tomatoes to help fall apart.

Mix together tomato paste and water and add in with all the spices (from curry powder to red pepper flakes), then stir to combine. Add a little oil if needed to help create paste like mixture.

Stir in coconut milk and stock until mixture is well combined. Add in chickpeas and bring to a simmer. Allow curry to simmer for 20-25 minutes to reduce and become creamy.

Stir in your spinach to wilt and gently cook until ready 1 - 2 minutes.

Serve with rice, naan, quinoa, etc. then top with fresh red or green onions, additional red flakes, and more! Enjoy!
