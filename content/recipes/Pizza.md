# Dough

* 5 1/4 cups (24 ounces by weight) unbleached bread flour
* 2 tsp (0.5 oz.) kosher salt
* 1 1/4 tsp (0.14 oz.) instant yeast (or 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast dissolved in the water)
* 2 tbsp (1 oz.) olive oil (optional)
* 1 tbsp (1/2 oz.) sugar or honey (optional)
* 2 1/4 cups (18 oz.) room temperature water (less if using honey or oil)

You can mix this by hand with a big spoon or in an electric mixer using the paddle (not the dough hook).

Combine all the ingredients in the bowl and mix for one minute, to form a coarse, sticky dough ball.

Let the dough rest for five minutes, then mix again for one minute to make a smooth, very tacky ball of dough.

Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, rub a little oil on your hands, and fold the dough into a smooth ball. Let it rest on the work surface for 5 minutes and then stretch and fold the dough into a tight ball. Repeat this again, two more times, at 5 minute intervals. Split into six evenly sized balls and place the dough on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Cover with saran wrap and refrigerate for up to two days.

When ready to make the pizzas, pull the dough from the refrigerator two hours prior to when you plan to bake. Give the dough at least 90 minutes before making the pizzas.

# Sauce

* 1 can (28 ounces) crushed or ground tomatoes (see comments above)
* 1 tsp salt (or to taste, start with ½ teaspoon and then adjust as needed)
* 1/4 tsp coarsely ground black pepper
* 1 tsp dried basil (optional) (or 2 tablespoons minced fresh basil)
* 1 tsp dried oregano (optional) (or 1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano)
* 1 tbsp granulated garlic powder (sandy, not the fine powder) (or 5 cloves of fresh garlic, minced or crushed)
* 1 to 2 tbsp red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, or lemon juice, or a combination of both (optional–some brands are more acidic than others, but I find that most benefit from at least 1 tablespoon)

Stir all the ingredients together, adding the salt gradually, to taste. (The basil and oregano are optional. I use both because I find most of my friends associate the flavors with childhood memories, but in an authentic Napoletana marinara pizza, made with true San Marzano sauce, you would use only oregano, and not in the sauce but as a garnish after the bake. The flavors of the herbs and garlic will intensify when the pizza is baked, so resist the urge to increase the amount). Do not cook this sauce–the tomatoes are already cooked when they go in the can and they will cook again on the pizza (of course, if using this over spaghetti or other pasta, in other words, if it won’t be cooked again in the oven, then you can heat it up in a pan). This sauce will keep for 1 week in the refrigerator.
