Mixed salad greens of choice

* Pan-toasted walnuts or slivered almonds
* Fresh blueberries, or dried peaches/apricots
* Gorgonzola, blue, or goat cheese

Pan toast walnut pieces or slivered almonds until just browned, but pull out their earthy/nutty flavor.

If using dried fruit, cut dried peaches or apricots into thin slivers.

Toss the salad greens with the dressing. Top with blueberries or dried peaches (or both! Or other fruit of choice!); crumbled cheese, and toasted nuts â€“ all to taste.

Maple Mustard Vinaigrette:

* 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
* 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
* 2 tbsp maple syrup
* 1/3 cup olive oil
* salt and pepper to taste
