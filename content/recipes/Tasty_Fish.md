## Marinade
* 1 cup soy souce
* ½ cup Asian Sesame oil
* ½ cup lime juice
* ¼ cup marin (sweet cooking Sake)
* 2 tablespoons fresh ginger, grated
* 2 medium cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoons red pepper flakes, crushed

## Procedure

In small bowl mix marinade ingredients. Place fish in large pan, and
pour marinade over it. Cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

For Tuna: Oil grill and light fire, allow coals to get very hot (or
set gas flame to high). Place tuna steaks on grill and cook 5 minutes
until grill marks appear, turn and grill another 5 minutes on other
side. Remove while it is still rare in the middle or it will become
dry. Serve immediately, garnished with cilantro.

For Salmon: Make a tin-foil tray about ¾ - 1 inch deep. Place tray on
BBQ (high / medium high). Put salmon in the center of the tray, cover
in marinade (leave enough room for it to boil without boiling over
into the BBQ). Cook until done (salmon should be pink, and still
slightly raw in center - about 7-10 minutes - Overdone salmon sucks,
so watch it carefully - you may wish to check your BBQ book on cook
times).
