# Ingredients
* 3.5 oz. (100 g) roughly chopped dark chocolate (I used 70% dairy-free dark chocolate)
* 1 package (12 oz.-340 g) organic silken tofu at room temperature, drained
* 2 tablespoons maple syrup
* optional: zest from an orange or orange extract
* optional: toppings like raspberries, chocolate shavings etc.

# Preparation
1. Melt the chocolate in the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring each time, until the chocolate is melted. Set aside to cool at room temperature.
2. Meanwhile, place the silken tofu and maple syrup in a food processor and blend until very smooth. Add the melted chocolate and blend until well combined.
3. Scoop the mixture into 3 ramekins or glasses, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 
4. To serve, garnish with chocolate shavings, raspberries, blackberries and a sprig of fresh mint.

Leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 3-4 days
