Quinoa:
 * 1+1/2 Tablespoon Olive Oil
 * 1 Tablespoon Garlic - finely chopped
 * 1/2 Cup / 125ml Tomato puree or Passata/Strained tomatoes
 * 1 Cup / 190g Quinoa (I have used tri-colour quinoa)
 * 1+1/3 Cup / 325ml Water OR as required
 * 1+1/2 Cup / 200g Frozen Corn

Salad:
 * 1 Cup / 150g Red Bell Pepper - cut into 1/2 X 1/2 inch pieces
 * 3/4 Cup / 140g Cherry/Grape Tomatoes - cut in half
 * 1/2 Cup / 65g Red Onion - chopped
 * 1/2 Cup / 30g Green Onion - chopped
 * 1/2 Cup / 15g Cilantro (Coriander leaves) - chopped
 * 1+1/2 Cup / 250g / 398ml Can  - Cooked Black Beans (Rinsed/Drained well)
 * Avocado to taste

Salad Dressing:
 * 3 Tablespoon Lemon Juice OR to taste
 * 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil (I have added Organic Cold Pressed Olive Oil)
 * 2 Tablespoon Maple syrup OR to taste
 * 1 Teaspoon Ground Cumin
 * 1/2 Teaspoon Ground Black Pepper
 * Salt to Taste (I have added 1+1/8 teaspoon of pink Himalayan salt)
 * (For extra heat you could add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper)

Start by chopping the vegetables and set it aside. Thoroughly rinse the quinoa until the water runs clear and set aside. Also, rinse the cooked black beans thoroughly in a strainer and set it aside to drain any excess water.

To a heated pan add olive oil, garlic, chili flakes and fry on medium-low heat until the garlic start's to sizzle. Be careful not to burn the garlic. Add the tomato puree/passata and cook on medium to medium-low heat for another 1 to 2 minutes to cook out the raw flavour of the puree.
Add the rinsed quinoa, water and mix well. Add the frozed corn and bring to a boil. Cover the lid and reduce the heat to low. Cook for about 20 minutes or until the quinoa is cooked. Donâ€™t let the quinoa get mushy.
As soon as the quinoa is cooked, transfer it to a large mixing bowl. Spread it our evenly and ALLOW IT TO COOL DOWN COMPLETELY.

To prepare the dressing add lemon juice, olive oil, maple syrup, ground cumin, ground black pepper and salt to a small bowl. Mix thoroughly and set it aside.

By now the quinoa would have cooled down, if not, wait till it completely cools down. Add the red bell pepper, Cherry/Grape tomatoes, red onion, green onion, cilantro and cooked black beans to the bowl with quinoa. Stir the dressing again to make sure everything is well incorporated. Then add the dressing to the quinoa/veggies and mix well. 

You can eat it right away, BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO CHILL THE SALAD IN THE REFRIDGERATOR FOR A COUPLE HOURS BEFORE SERVING. This will allow the flavours to blend and it tastes so good cold. This salad is good just on it's own, but you can top with avocado just before serving
