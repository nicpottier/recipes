# Ingredients
* 3 oz (85 g) soy curls, or Textured Vegetable Protein Chunks
* ½ cup (120 ml) vegetable broth, or water (to rehydrate the soy curls)
* 2 tablespoon oil
* 4 large vegan sausages, sliced, I used Beyond Meat
* 1 large onion, minced
* 2 ribs celery
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 3 stalks green onions, sliced
* 2 large green bell peppers, diced
* 1 red chili pepper, deseeded and chopped – optional
* 2 cups (400 g) brown long-grain rice
* 2 tablespoon cajun seasoning
* 1 bay leaf
* 2 teaspoon thyme
* 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 can (410 g) chopped tomatoes, (15oz can)
* 4 cups (1 L) vegetable broth
* 1 can pinto beans

# Preparation
1. Add the soy curls or chunks to a bowl and cover with ½ cup water or broth. Allow it to rehydrate for 10 minutes.
2. Heat the oil in a large pot or dutch oven on medium heat and add the sliced vegan sausages. Cook until browned all over. Remove from the pot and set aside.
3. Add the onions and celery. Cook and stir occasionally until browned.
4. Add the garlic, green onions, bell pepper and chilli pepper. Cook until the garlic starts to brown.
5. Stir in the rice, soy curls, sausages, cajun seasoning, bay leaf and thyme. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
6. Stir in the tomatoes and vegetable stock. Cover and bring to boil. Stir then reduce the heat to low.
7. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes until the rice is cooked. Stir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Add more stock if needed.
8. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed. Remove from the heat and serve.
